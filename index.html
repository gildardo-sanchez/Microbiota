            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The microbiota refers to the community of microorganisms that inhabit various parts of our body, particularly the gut. These microorganisms play a critical role in maintaining our health by aiding in digestion, producing vitamins, and protecting against harmful pathogens.</p>
            <p>Understanding the microbiota and its interactions with our body can lead to significant advancements in health and disease treatment. This project explores the intersection of microbiota and artificial intelligence to uncover new insights and potential therapies.</p>
